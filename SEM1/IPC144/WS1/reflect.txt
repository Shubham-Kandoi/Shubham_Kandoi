A1. No, I do not have any kind of previous experience in programming/coding.Initially, I thought programming and this course would be difficult and very tedious task to understand, however after starting to learn about C language I feel C is easy to understand if we focus on the concepts and basics of C language.

A2.According to me compiling C text file into an executable program contain 3 major steps ;
1.First our code preprocesed by a preproccesor which prepares the code for compilation
2.Secondly, the code is passed to the compiler and then it checks the for syntax errors if there is no errors it will genrate contains machine code.
3.To create an excecutable file we have to link machine code with an external libraries. 

A3.There are lots of things to achieve in this IPC144 course:
1.I hope to learn the basic concepts of programming/coding, which will set a stage for me to explore furter in complex programming topics and more advance concepts.
2. I hope I can develop a problem solving skills by coding.
3. By learning C I hope that I can learn concepts like variables, data types, loops, functions, arrays and many more.
4.Expect to develop a debugging skills. After learning this skill I will know how to fix my errors in code.
5. I expect or my goal is that by the end of this course I should be comfortabel with synatx, data types, functions and other basic concepts.
6.I expext by this IPC course I can use this knowledge in the real world which can develop my practical coding skills.
