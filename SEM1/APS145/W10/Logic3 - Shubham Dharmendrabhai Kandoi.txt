Data Structure:

room_Length
room_Width
room_Height
room_Area
ceiling_Area
num_Doors
door_Area
door_Length
door_Width
door_Area
num_Windows
window_Length
window_Width
window_Area
net_Paintable_Area


1) Start

2)Prompt user to input the dimensions(room_Length,room_Width,room_Heigth) of the room in meters.

3) Display:

Room Length = (room_Length)
Room Width = (room_Width)
Room Height = (room_Height)

4)Calculate the total area of the room (room_Area):
room_Area = 2*(room_Length*room_Height) + 2*(room_Width*room_Height)

5)Display:
Total Area of the Room = (room_Area)

6)Calculate Ceiling Area of the Room:
ceiling_Area = room_Length * room_Width

7)Prompt user to input the number of doors in the room (num_Doors)

8)Prompt user to input door_Length and door_Height of the door.

9) Calculate the Area of a door :
	door_area = num_Doors * (door_Length * door_Width)

10) Prompt user to enter the number of windows in the room.
Number of windows = [num_Windows]

11) Calculate the area of window :
window_Area = num_Windows * (windows_Length * windows_Width)

12)Display :
Total Area of the room = [room_Area]
Total Area of Cei;ing = [ceiling_Area]
Total Area of Windows = [window_Area]
Total Area of  Door = [door_Area]

 13) Is there any other room you want to paint?
	
	Yes: 
	Repeat the process from the step #2
	
	No: 
	Proceed to the next step

14) Calculate the Total Paintable Area :
net_Paintable_Area = room_Area + ceiling_Area - door_Area - window_Area

15) Display : 
Total Paintable Area = [net_Paintable_Area]

16) End
